Also, as a CPAP user myself, I understand the ups and downs that come with managing this sleep disorder. How I found out I have sleep apnea was a fluke. I was suffering from severe depression and anxiety and every other test was coming back normal. Who would have thought that sleep apnea was the problem since I was an active young woman in her twenties?! Checking my sleep was just something to check off the list. Turns out, the lack of oxygen was a major reason behind my mental health struggles.</p><p>Hence, the name Mental Health Naps. Before I knew I had sleep apnea, I had to take naps daily; because one, I would be exhausted by the afternoon and two, taking a nap always provided a mental reset when dealing with a mental episode. Then it just turned out that all this was about sleep in the end. Therefore, my focus on staying mentally healthy is through sleep, which is imperative to being healthy overall.</p><p>I’m a true Pacific North Westy. I’ve lived here most of my life. I have lived abroad in the Netherlands, North Belgium, and Sweden. I’m half Swedish which explains where my name, Kajsa (Ky-SUH or Ka-i-sa), comes from.</p><p>I love to write with a Diet Coke in hand and I love a good laugh. I usually say no one can make me laugh harder than myself. Also, laughter has been a huge part in helping me accept my life with sleep apnea because it took me a long time to mentally accept it.</p><p>Accepting my situation with a sleep disorder and mental health struggles, I am determined to manage them with smiles and not tears. I’ve cried a lot about having sleep apnea and mental illness and for years I wasn’t okay with myself for having them. But with time, patience, positive self-talk, and changing perspective – I’ve come to realize that however grim it might appear, I’m fully capable of living a full and happy life. Life is too short and valuable to not fight back against my sleep disorder and mental illness.</p><p>The purpose of sharing my story is to offer a positive, but realistic hope of living with sleep apnea and mental health conditions. Sleep health and mental health are intimately connected. Sleep is how your mind (and the rest of your body) repair and recover. If something is interfering with your sleep, the rest of your body is going to feel a negative impact.</p><p>All in all, I hope that following Mental Health Naps helps you on your own sleep apnea/CPAP/mental health journey. May we find laughter, acceptance, and support together as we all strive to find answers and health to enjoy life.</p><p>Wishing you the best of ZZZ’s,</p><p>Kajsa</p></div>",1);var p={__name:"About",setup(e){return(e,a)=>((0,n.wg)(),(0,n.iD)("section",l,[(0,n._)("div",i,[(0,n._)("div",o,[(0,n._)("div",r,[(0,n.Wm)(s.Z),h])])])]))}};const d=p;var u=d}}]);
