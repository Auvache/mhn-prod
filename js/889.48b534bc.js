It hopefully sits on your face all night, every night. Though I will admit, I have a fair share of nights when my CPAP mask jumps off my face and lands who knows where, and I have to look for it in the morning.</p><p>Keeping your CPAP mask clean helps keep your skin clear, as a dirty mask can introduce a skin reaction. I would also like to add that a regular daily cleaning routine helps the mask keep its seal and shape for longer. (However, they do eventually wear out and cushions do need replacing.)</p><p class="tagline mb-3"><i>*PLEASE NOTE – the cushion is referring to the piece of the mask that sits on or under your nose if you have a nasal mask and around the mouth if you have a full-face mask.</i></p><p>When I got my CPAP mask, I was told the best way to clean it was with mild dish soap like Dawn and warm water. However, knowing myself, I knew that dunking my mask in water and soap every day was too big of a commitment, so I set out for a different solution. </p><p>Thus, <a href="https://amzn.to/3vDm0cw" target="_blank">special CPAP wipes became my solution.</a></p><p>I&#39;ve noticed in comment sections on my various posts that people like to use other methods of cleaning their mask. I&#39;ve seen everything from baby wipes to disinfecting wipes to straight up vinegar. If you clean your mask using any of these methods and it&#39;s working for you no problem, awesome. </p><p>But here are my reasons for specifically sticking with these CPAP wipes.</p><p><span class="fw-bold">Reason number one</span> - they don’t smell. There isn’t a fragrance added like perhaps baby wipes and they don’t have that “wet smell” that I find with baby wipes. Cleaning with vinegar is not an option for me, as the smell inspires me to pass out. Plus I don’t know how healthy it is to sniff all the chemical smells from disinfecting wipes such as Clorox or Lysol. When the mask is dry after using the CPAP wipes, it smells like nothing every time. </p><p><span class="fw-bold">Reason number two</span> - if you ask me, baby wipes and cleaning wipes are made with different surfaces in mind. Baby wipes are made to wipe skin, not silicon (which most masks are made of). Sure, the mask sits on your skin, but you aren’t cleaning your skin. You’re cleaning your mask. I also feel like there are less ingredients in the CPAP masks versus the baby wipes for this reason, thus in my mind, less ingredients cleaning the mask the better. I mean it is recommended to use mild dish soap for a reason. Cleaning wipes such as Clorox and Lysol are for hard surfaces such as your kitchen counter or bathtub. On some CPAP masks, the silicon is pretty thin and I feel like harsh cleaners would cause the mask cushion to break down faster thus affecting the seal and fit to my face.</p><p><span class="fw-bold">Reason number three</span> - I have sensitive skin. Like really sensitive. I’m allergic to most fun or trending lotions. For example, sheep produce lanolin, which is a common ingredient in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulas. Lanolin makes me break into hives. Don’t ask me to hug your goat. I only use products on my skin that my dermatologist has approved. I even have to make my own laundry soap because I can’t handle store brand laundry detergents. That being said, I’ve used the CPAP wipes for years and never have had any skin irritation on my face from my CPAP mask. The fewer ingredients in the products I use the better. I tend to shy away from the idea of using baby wipes on my face and regular cleaning wipes recommend you wear gloves while using them, so no… I wouldn’t be cleaning my CPAP mask with them either. Plus I don’t think I would ever wash my face with vinegar, so that’s not an option either. </p><p><span class="fw-bold">Reason number four</span> - the CPAP wipes are convenient. They aren’t as big as your standard baby wipe size, so you don’t waste much and one canister lasts forever. I keep them in my bedside table so they’re easily accessible. I can do a quick wipe down and boom, done. I do like to try and wash my CPAP with mild dish soap and warm water every once in a while, but for someone who knows who they are and knows they need to keep their mask clean every day… </p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3vDm0cw" target="_blank">CPAP wipes</a> are a way of life for me.</p></div>',1);var d={__name:"CPAPWipes",setup(e){return(e,a)=>((0,n.wg)(),(0,n.iD)("section",i,[(0,n._)("div",o,[(0,n._)("div",r,[(0,n._)("div",l,[(0,n.Wm)(t.Z),h])])])]))}};const u=d;var m=u}}]);
