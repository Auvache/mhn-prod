It’s important to change these filters every couple weeks (or check to see if it’s gray or not…). Funny story, I wasn’t aware of this filter for a long, long time… Because of this, it interfered with my CPAP being able to accurately collect my data as it documented vibrations. My sleep doctor started thinking there was something else wrong with me. However, when I changed the filter… everything worked as normal. </p><p>It also can get in the way of your CPAP use because honestly how healthy is it to breathe in gray matter.</p><p>If you need help finding replacement filters, here are some links on Amazon that I’ve used in the past or currently use now. Depending on the CPAP machine you have, you might have disposable or reusable filters, so pay attention to that. Here are the filters needed for the different CPAP machines that I have had in the past that might help you find what you need now. </p><h3 class="t3"><a href="https://amzn.to/421BJhD" target="_blank">Philips Respironics Dreamstation</a></h3><p class="tagline mb-3"><i>*This machine was recalled, but refurbished machines are still being used. </i></p><p>Filter has two parts- A thicker top part that is a darker blue and then a thinner part that is a light blue that sits below. The thinner blue part is what you change more often. </p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3tLTrJx" target="_blank">Light blue part only</a></p><h3 class="t3"><a href="https://amzn.to/3vDXU1p" target="_blank">Philips Respironics Dreamstation 2</a></h3><p>This CPAP has two filters: the gray one is reusable, and the blue is disposable. Check the blue one every few weeks and throw it away if it looks dirty. The gray can be washed with water and left to completely air dry. However, it might be good to replace the gray filter every few months.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/47EvtNU" target="_blank">Gray Filter</a></p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/4aUGjCr" target="_blank">Blue Filter</a></p><h3 class="t3"><a href="https://amzn.to/3S3c4QW" target="_blank">ResMed (All ResMed Air 20, Airsense 10, Aircurve 10, S9 Series, Airstart, etc)</a></h3><p>For these machines it’s only one disposable filter and is recommended to change out every couple weeks or so. </p><br><p>Hope this helps you find the filters you need so you can keep that CPAP sleep clean! </p></div>',1);var p={__name:"CPAPFilters",setup(e){return(e,t)=>((0,s.wg)(),(0,s.iD)("section",n,[(0,s._)("div",r,[(0,s._)("div",l,[(0,s._)("div",o,[(0,s.Wm)(i.Z),h])])])]))}};const c=p;var u=c}}]);
