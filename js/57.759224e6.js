That usually means that there is too much water in your CPAP hose that in turn sometimes ends up in your CPAP mask. This is called CPAP Rainout. </p><p>There are a few tips and tricks that can help you resolve this. But something to consider before you investigate what you need to solve this problem- understand that CPAPs pressurize the air in the room where you’re sleeping. The humidity settings you need to set your CPAP to will largely depend on the climate you live in and might change with the seasons. A good rule of thumb is the drier the climate, the more humidity your CPAP needs. The more humid the climate, the less humidity your CPAP needs. </p><p class="fw-bold"><i>If you have water in your hose- your humidity is too high. </i></p><p>However, even this needs to be adjusted to the climate that you live in and how you are maintaining your home temperature. I’ll use where I live as an example. I live in the Pacific Northwest, 194 feet above sea level. I live in a more humid climate. In the summer, when the AC is blasting I turn the humidity on my CPAP down and go without water in the water tank. A heated hose is really all I need. </p><p>In the winter, depending on the rain, I’d often have to turn the humidity up on my machine because I have the heater drying my house out. However, when I was going to college in a much higher elevation. I found that I needed higher humidity in general as the air there was thinner and drier. </p><p>That being said, it takes a little bit of trial and error to figure out what humidity settings you need on your CPAP for where you live. </p><p>Here are some tips/products to consider helping with CPAP Rainout.</p><p class="tagline"><i>*When it comes to purchasing CPAP products, I like to price check with Amazon.
